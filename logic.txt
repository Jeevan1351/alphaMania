The game here is simple.
A random yet controlled grid of alphabets is generated based on the level the player is in.
Each time the grid is generated a target variable is picked and is inserted into certain random positions in the grid.
The target element has to be selected from the grid within the given time to complete the current round.


A simple strategy has been used to measure the progress and standard of player.
There are a 3 levels and each level having 3 rounds.
When all three rounds are completed then the player is promoted to the next level.
The difficulty of a level is the proportional to the size of the grid.
Level one contains an 8X8 grid.
Level two contains a 12X12 grid.
Level three contains a 20X20 grid.
With each of these levels having three rounds.
In case a correct answer in time, the player is promoted to the next level.
If there is a wrong answer or the time runs out then the player is demoted to the first round of the current level.
So three consistent success are required to go to the next level which serves as a effective measure to check the standard of player.
